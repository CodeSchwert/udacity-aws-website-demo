Static website and resources for Udacity teaching demo.

# Globe

The Globe static webpage in the `/public` folder is a modified Google Chrome experiment created by the Google Data Arts Team. The original code can be found here: 

- Github repo: https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe
- Chrome Experiments: https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/globe
- Globe live demo: http://globe.chromeexperiments.com/

The `index.html` file needed to be moved to the top level for the relative `/global` URL paths to work correctly.
